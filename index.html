    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is a methedology that web developers use to make websites avaliable to a whole bunch of different people. It focuses on content first and allows people using different devices and browsers to access the same site. Progressive enhancement is different from graceful degredation because it solves a greater number of problems. It is important to modern web developers because it allows them to show their website to the multitude of new browsers and devices that have been created without worrying about whether or not the site will show correctly.</p>

    <h2>Dragon Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project was extremely satisfying for me. There were things that I did well, and things that I struggled with but prevailed over. I did the coding well, but I have a problem on the creative side of a project. The design part I struggle with because I really have no eye for that sort of thing. The thing I would do differently if I had to start over would be to have an idea of how I am going to lay out the site before I started the project.</p>
    <p>The feedback I got helped me to fix my project. It is as follows: add a favicon, add padding between text boxes, add padding between text box titles and box walls or center text, normalize height and width of text boxes, on FAQ pages, differentiate between the two titles, and on link bar homepage should either be first or last. I addressed all of these issues with my document. I had to really think about this and figure out the first issue. I had an issue with the padding of text boxes, but I figured that out through research and persistence. This project was extremely satisfying because of the struggle and hard work I had to put into it to make it work.</p>
